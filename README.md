# Traffic-Light
<br>
<p>This code simulates a traffic light sequence using <strong>Python's Turtle graphics</strong> library. It draws a traffic light structure and then enters a loop where it displays a red light for 10 seconds, an orange light for 5 seconds, and a green light for 5 seconds, repeating the sequence indefinitely. The lights are animated by repeatedly drawing and erasing circles to create a blinking effect.</p><br>
